# Mini-Pacman-game
This is a mini pacman game for Arduino where you simply move the Pacman around the screen whitout any distraction: no obstacles, no ghosts and no point, just a simply game to relax yourself!

Attention:
for play the game, you need to enable the "toggle autoscroll" in the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE:
